# StudyApp

A lightweight, browser-based study and quiz application built with **Angular 16.2.16** and styled using **Bootstrap 5.3.8**.
This app allows users to upload their own JSON-formatted quiz files and dynamically generate quizzes directly in the browser — no backend required.

This project is deployed to GitHub Pages using **angular-cli-ghpages v2.0.3**.

> **Note:** This repository is primarily a personal project and part of a growing portfolio, but contributions are still welcome.

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

This project includes an npm script that builds and deploys the application with a single command.

### **Custom Deploy Script**

In `package.json`, you may have something like:

```json
"scripts": {
  "deploy-study-app": "ng build --configuration production && ng deploy --base-href=/StudyApp/ --dir=dist/study-app/browser"
}
```

### **How It Works**

* **ng build --configuration production**
  Generates an optimized production build under:
  `dist/study-app/browser`

* **ng deploy**
  Uses `angular-cli-ghpages` to publish the build to GitHub Pages (`gh-pages` branch`).

### **To deploy:**

```bash
npm run deploy-study-app
```

After ~1–2 minutes, GitHub Pages will update the live site.
